Upload model_info.json to Google Drive

Note: For simplest approach, manually download model_info.json 
from Codespaces and upload it to Google Drive alongside best_model.h5

If you want to automate uploads, you'll need to:
1. Install google-drive-api: pip install google-api-python-client google-auth
2. Set up OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
3. Use the code below (requires setup)

# For now, use manual upload or gdown doesn't support uploads
# Use the manual method described in the comments above

print("📋 Manual Upload Instructions:")
print("1. Download model_info.json from Codespaces")
print("2. Go to Google Drive folder with best_model.h5")
print("3. Upload model_info.json there")
print("4. Both files will be together! ✅")
